Challenge: Build a Mad Libs Generator with Conditional Statements!

Get creative and have some fun with Python! This challenge will help you solidify your understanding of conditional statements while putting your problem-solving skills to the test.

What is Mad Libs?

Mad Libs is a classic word game where players fill in the blanks of a story with random words, creating a silly and often nonsensical narrative.

Your Task:
Create a Python program that generates a Mad Libs story using conditional statements. Here’s what your program should achieve:

Prompt the user: Ask the user for different words following specific prompts, such as a noun, verb, adjective, etc.
Store the user’s input: Use input() to capture the user’s words and store them in variables.
Build the story: Construct a story template with placeholders for the user-provided words.
Conditional Touches (Bonus): Use conditional statements (if, else) to add some variation to the story based on the user’s input.
Display the final story:Print the complete Mad Libs story with the user’s inserted words.

Tips:
Use descriptive variable names to improve code readability.
Consider adding more prompts and placeholders for a richer story.
Feel free to experiment with different story themes and conditional variations.
